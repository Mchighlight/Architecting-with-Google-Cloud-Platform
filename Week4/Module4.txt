#Lab1 : Google Cloud Platform API Infrastructure Automation v1.5 超重要!!
##Objectives
* Create an IAM service account
* Create a VM
* Authorize it to use Google Cloud API using the Service Account
* Install open-source software on the VM, configure the software, and test it by deploying a Hadoop cluster
* Create a snapshot of the boot disk with the Service Account authority "baked in"
* Recreate the clustermaker VM in a different region and test it by deploying another Hadoop cluster in the new region
##Tasks
Task 1: Create and authorize a VM to use the Cloud SDK
Task 2: Customize the VM
Task 3: Test the clustermaker
Task 4: Take the custom solution global
Task 5: Test your global deployment tool
Task 6: Create tunnels
Task 7: Create static routes
Task 8: Verify VPN connectivity
